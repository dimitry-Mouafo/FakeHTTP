```

For more detailed usage, refer to the help command:

```bash
./fakehttp -help
```

## Configuration

FakeHTTP comes with a configuration file located at `config.json`. You can modify this file to change the default settings. Here are some key parameters you can adjust:

- **port**: Set the port for HTTP connections.
- **timeout**: Define the timeout for connections.
- **log_level**: Adjust the logging level (info, debug, error).

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "timeout": 30,
  "log_level": "info"
}
```

## Topics

This project covers several important topics:

- **iptables**: A user-space utility program that allows a system administrator to configure the IP packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall.
- **netfilter-queue**: A part of the netfilter framework that allows you to intercept and modify packets in the kernel space.
- **nfqueue**: A queuing mechanism that allows user-space applications to receive packets from the kernel.
- **obfuscation**: Techniques used to make communication less detectable.
